```

### Problem 2

``` r
homi_data = 
  read.csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

**Describe the raw data:**

- The dataset has 12 variables and 52179 observations.

  - “uid”(the abbreviation of city - number); “reported_date”

  - “victim_last”(last name of victim); “victim_first”(first name of
    victim); “victim_race”; “victim_age”; “victim_sex”

  - “city”; “state”; “lat”(latitude); “lon”(longitude);

  - “disposition”:

    - Closed by arrest when *police reported that to be the case*
    - Closed without arrest when *police reported that to be
      “exceptionally cleared.”* Those are cases in which there is
      sufficient evidence but an arrest is not possible, for example, if
      the suspect has died.
    - Open/No arrest: *All other cases* were classified as having no
      arrest.

Then, create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”) and then
summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the
number of unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed
without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).

``` r
homi_data = 
  homi_data %>% 
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", ", collapse = NULL)) 

total_df = 
  homi_data %>% 
  group_by(city) %>% 
  summarize(total_number_homicide = n())
total_df
```
