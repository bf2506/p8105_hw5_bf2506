library(tidyverse)
```

### Problem 2

``` r
homi_data = 
  read.csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

**Describe the raw data:**

- The dataset has 12 variables and 52179 observations.

  - “uid”(the abbreviation of city - number); “reported_date”

  - “victim_last”(last name of victim); “victim_first”(first name of
    victim); “victim_race”; “victim_age”; “victim_sex”

  - “city”; “state”; “lat”(latitude); “lon”(longitude);

  - “disposition”:

    - Closed by arrest when *police reported that to be the case*
    - Closed without arrest when *police reported that to be
      “exceptionally cleared.”* Those are cases in which there is
      sufficient evidence but an arrest is not possible, for example, if
      the suspect has died.
    - Open/No arrest: *All other cases* were classified as having no
      arrest.
